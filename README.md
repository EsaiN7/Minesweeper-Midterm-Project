# Minesweeper-Midterm-Project
This was my midterm project for Handheld Game Development. I really enjoyed this class, and finally got to use Java in it! This
project was the first time I had used Android Studio as well, and it provided a lot of great tools to help with developing a simple app.

I have provided all the required files on this repo to install the game on a physical android device, or play it with a virtual android device.

Have fun and good luck!
